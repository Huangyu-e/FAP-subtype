# FAP-subtype
Breast cancer exhibits marked heterogeneity. Through ferroptosis-related miRNAs, we identified a subtype with ferroptosis-active phenotype (FAP+), characterized by high immunogenicity. The derived FAPscore reliably predicts immunotherapy response, prognosis, and drug sensitivity, advancing personalized treatment strategies.
